# Introduction

This is the Mixed Messages project in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer track.

## Implementation

I decided to create a Mad Lib generator for this project. The JS file contains a series of arrays composed of various parts of speech, a function to randomly select a word from the array, and a function to output a sentence from a set of pre-made Mad Libs.
